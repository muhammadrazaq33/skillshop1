                The biggest difference between other productivity software and
                Google Workspace for Education is the concept of a live
                document. With live document sharing, your students can share
                documents with you and each other for peer feedback or group
                projects.
              </p>
              <p className="">
                You can share live documents with other colleagues to work
                collaboratively on lesson plans or other classroom resources.
                With a live document, there is only one version and edits are
                made in real-time. When you, or someone you are collaborating
                with, make a change to the document, those changes are all saved
                in the same place for everyone to see. Instead of an offline,
                desktop-based document, you can work together with students or
                colleagues in real-time.

                        many years, and they would like to revise it with
                        colleagues. The teacher would like to share the project

                        changes, and emailed the new versions back. By the time
                        everyone in the group responded, this process created
                        5-6 different versions of the same document. The teacher
