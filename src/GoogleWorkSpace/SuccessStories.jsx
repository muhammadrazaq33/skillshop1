              A lot of classrooms have - and will continue to have - textbooks.
              They’re an important part of the classroom, and aren’t
              disappearing any time soon. But that doesn’t mean you can’t
              augment them to further engage students and make connections to

              As teachers, we know the value of good citizenship in the
              classroom and school community. But today, students need to be
              good citizens in the digital world as well. Their digital behavior
              has a big impact on themselves and others, and what makes good or
              bad digital citizenship may not always be clear.

            <p>
              At the school level, policies and procedures and a defined digital
              citizenship curriculum can help guide you in the classroom. These
              help make students aware of what they should and shouldn’t be
              doing, with the goal of keeping themselves safe online.

            Google Workspace for Education is a suite of applications that can
            help you increase opportunities for critical thinking,
            communication, collaboration, and creativity, all while supporting
            the learning objectives that you have for your students.{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            These tools are relevant, easy to use, and introduce students to new
            ways of learning. And they will help make your work more efficient
            by streamlining processes like how you organize and store your class
            materials, create and maintain your grade book, communicate
            important class updates, contact guardians, and schedule
            conferences.
          </p>
          <p>
            Throughout this course, we'll introduce you to the basics of using
            Google Workspace for Education in your classroom through videos,
            examples, reflection points, and more. But before you get started,
